##' This function returns the default authentication object from the
##' package environment.  If no default authentication has been
##' established yet, will return NULL.  If using a desktop/workstation
##' session, NULL will work fine.  If using SAPI/Bpipe, you may need
##' to use blpAuthenticate() to create an authentication object.
##'
##' @title Return the default authentication object
##'
##' @details For the authentication object, the required arguments
##' \code{uuid} and \code{ip} argument can be set via
##' \code{\link{options}} as \code{uuid} and \code{blpIP}. In
##' addition, if an additional option \code{blpAutoConnect} is set
##' to \sQuote{TRUE} and \code{blpAutoAuthenticate} is set to
##' \sQuote{TRUE}, a connection and authentication is established
##' in the \code{.onAttach()} function and stored in the package
##' environment. This effectively frees users from having to
##' explicitly create such an object. Of course, the user can also
##' call \code{blpAuthenticate} explicitly and store the
##' authentication object.  This helper function looks up the
##' stored authentication object and returns it. In case no
##' authentication has been established, NULL is returned.  (NULL
##' is sufficent for Desktop API connections.)
