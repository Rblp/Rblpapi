\section{Changes in Rblpapi version 0.3.4 (2016-06-30)}{
  \itemize{
    \item The internal header \code{Rblpapi_types.h} was renamed from a
    lower-cased variant to conform with Rcpp Attributes best practices.
  }
}

\section{Changes in Rblpapi version 0.3.3 (2016-03-14)}{
  \itemize{
    \item \code{configure} adds a missing \code{method="libcurl"}
    options (PR \ghpr{109} by Martin Bel).
    \item New function \code{bsrch()} adds basic search functionality
    (PR \ghpr{111} by Morgan Williams fixing ticket \ghit{82}).
    \item The licensing status of the Rblpapi source package was
    clarified (PR \ghpr{119}).
    \item The \code{bds()} help page now shows an example using an
    \code{overrides} argument (PR \ghpr{121}).
    \item A new function \code{fieldInfo} was added, and field
    information is used in \code{bdh} and \code{bdp} (PRs \ghpr{122},
    \ghpr{123}, \ghpr{125}, and \ghpr{127}).
    \item The \code{bdp} function now checks the order (PR \ghpr{126}).
    \item Unit testing was added (PRs \ghpr{129} and \ghpr{131}).
    \item Data retrieval is now smarter about the types returned from
    Bloomberg (PR \ghpr{132} and \ghpr{133}; and \ghpr{141} and \ghpr{142}).
    \item The \code{bdh} and \code{bds} functions now support an option
    \code{verbose} (PRs \ghpr{138}).
  }
}

\section{Changes in Rblpapi version 0.3.2 (2015-12-06)}{
  \itemize{
    \item A new \code{subscribe()} function supports live data
    subscription for a set of tickers and fields (\ghpr{88}).
    \item In the \code{beqs()} example the correct date format is used
    (PR \ghpr{85} by Rademeyer).
    \item Both \code{getTicks()} and \code{getBars()} now check the
    start and end times for proper \code{Datetime} class.
    \item The \code{getBars()} function now also return the
    \sQuote{value traded} (request of \ghit{89}).
    \item An error in the documentation for \code{bdh} was corrected (PR
    \ghpr{93} by Rademeyer closing \ghit{85}).
    \item The \code{beqs()} function is now more robust with respect to
    empty return columns (PR \ghpr{100} by Rademeyer fixing ticket
    \ghit{99}).
    \item The \code{getBars()} function now uses a single (named) vector
    \code{options} to pass optional values to the underlying function
    (PR \ghpr{105} updating PR \ghpr{48} and fixing \ghit{47}). 
    \item When R is built with libcurl support, it used to download the
    build-time library and headers; otherwise \code{curl} is used. This
    avoids an issue on OS X where \code{curl} is insufficient.

\section{Changes in Rblpapi version 0.3.1 (2015-10-19)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Added \code{beqs()} to run Bloomberg Equity Screen Search,

    \ghpr{83} and \ghpr{84} by Dirk; closes tickets \ghit{63} and \ghit{80}.
    \item Bloomberg header and library files are now cached locally
    instead of being re-downloaded for every build (PR \ghpr{78}
    by Dirk addressing issue \ghpr{65}).
    \item For multiple ticks, time-stamps are unique-yfied before
    merging (PR \ghpr{77} by Dirk addressing issue \ghit{76}).
    \item A compiler warning under new g++ versions is now suppressed
    (PR \ghpr{69} by John, fixing \ghit{68}).
  }
