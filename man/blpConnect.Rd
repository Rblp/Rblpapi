\title{Establish connection to Bloomberg service}
\usage{
blpConnect(host = getOption("blpHost", "localhost"),
  port = getOption("blpPort", 8194L), default = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{host}{A character option with either a machine name that is
resolvable by DNS, or an IP address. Defaults to
\sQuote{localhost}.}

\item{port}{An integer variable with the connection port. Default
to \code{8194L}.}

\item{default}{A logical indicating whether this connection should
be saved as the default, as opposed to returned to the
user. Default to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
In the \code{default=TRUE} case nothing is returned, and
this connection is automatically used for all future calls which
omit the \code{con} argument. Otherwise a connection object is
returned which is required by all the accessor functions in the
package.
}
\description{
This function connects to the Bloomberg API
}
\details{
For both \code{host} and \code{port} argument, default
values can also be specified via \code{\link{options}} using,
respectively, the named entries \code{blpHost} and
\code{blpConnect}.

If an additional option \code{blpAutoConnect} is set to
\sQuote{TRUE}, a connection is established in the
\code{.onAttach()} function and stored in the package
environment. This effectively frees users from having to
explicitly create such an object.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  con <- blpConnect()   # adjust as needed
}
}
\seealso{
Many SAPI and bPipe connections require authentication 
via \code{blpAuthenticate} after \code{blpConnect}.
