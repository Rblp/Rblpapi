## Introduction

The [Rblpapi package](https://github.com/Rblp/Rblpapi) connects the
[R language and environment for statistical computing](https://www.r-project.org)
to the [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com) services supported by the
[official Bloomberg APIs](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/support/api-library/).

The [Rblpapi package](https://github.com/Rblp/Rblpapi) is provided in both
source and binary (for Windows and OS X) via the
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) network for R.  Source code is available
[at the corresponding GitHub repo](https://github.com/Rblp/Rblpapi); the
[blp repo](https://github.com/Rblp/blp) contains the Bloomberg API components
required during the build.

## Usage

The next few section illustrate key functions within the package. All
functions also have proper help pages for fuller details.

### Package Load

Use

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(Rblpapi)
````

to load the package.  You can also set options which will
automatically connect at package load; see the next section.

### Connecting

Use

```{r, eval=FALSE}
blpConnect()
```

which will connect to the Bloomberg backend. Default values for the IP
address (127.0.0.1) and port (8194) are used and can be overridden both
as function arguments and via global options `blpHost` and `blpPort`.
Moreover, if option `blpAutoConnect` is set to `TRUE`, this connection
is done at package load.

The `appName` argument is optional and is for Application-Name
authentication (via B-PIPE or SAPI, see `blpAuthenticate()`).

The resulting connection object is stored in a per-package environment
providing a default value.  If needed it can be overridden in each
accessor function.

As the connection object is being held onto, the `blpDisconnect()`
function is implemented as an empty function without side-effects.  The
internal function `defaultConnection()` returns the default connection
object.

Default arguments and auto-connect can be set via `options()`

```{R, eval=FALSE}
options("blpAutoConnect" = TRUE)
options("blpHost" = "x.x.x.x")
options("blpPort" = 8194)
options("blpAppName" = "yyy")
```

Optionally use
```{R, eval=FALSE}
blpAuthenticate()
```

`blpAuthenticate()` is usually needed for SAPI & B-PIPE sessions.  DAPI
(Desktop) sessions do not usually require calling `blpAuthenticate()`,
and will function with a default NULL `identity` object.  

`blpAuthenticate()` connects to SAPI/B-PIPE server, and authenticates
via UUID/login-location or Application-Name.  It can set a default
identity object for future calls (`bdp()`, `bds()`, etc).  Or it can
return an identity object to explicitly pass to future calls.

Additionally, if `blpAutoAuthenticate` is true, `blpAuthenticate()` will
be called at package load, storing a default identity object. The
internal function `defaultAuthentication()` returns the default identity
object.

If needed, the default identity object can be overridden in each
accessor function.

Default arguments and auto-authentication can be set via `options()`

```{R, eval=FALSE}
options("blpAutoAuthenticate" = TRUE)
options("blpUUID" = "xxx")
options("blpLoginHostname" = "yyy")
options("blpLoginIP" = "z.z.z.z")

```

For application-id authentication, first use `blpConnect()` with an
`appName` argument.  Then call `blpAuthenticate()` with no arguments.


```{R, eval=FALSE}
blpConnect( ... , appName = "appName")
blpAuthenticate()
```

For UUID authentication, connect with `blpConnect()`, then
`blpAuthenticate()` with the UUID and last hostname/IP the UUID logged
in from.  Usually this is the IP of your Bloomberg Terminal.  For your
UUID, `IAM <GO>` in Bloomberg Terminal.  Note, if you supply both IP and
host arguments, the IP will be used, and the host ignored.


```{R, eval=FALSE}
blpConnect( ... )
blpAuthenticate( uuid="UUID", ip.address="x.x.x.x")
```


### bdp: Bloomberg Data Point

Current (or most recent) values of market-related instruments can be accessed
via the `bdp()` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bdp(c("ESA Index", "SPY US Equity"), c("PX_LAST", "VOLUME"))
```

### bds: Bloomberg Data Set 

The `bds()` function can retrieve data of a more static nature:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bds("GOOG US Equity", "TOP_20_HOLDERS_PUBLIC_FILINGS")
```

### bdh: Bloomberg Data History

Historical data (at a daily granularity) can be retrieved with `bdh()`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bdh("SPY US Equity", c("PX_LAST", "VOLUME"), start.date=Sys.Date()-31)
```

### getBars: OHLCV Aggregates

The `getBars()` function retrieves aggregated Open / High / Low /
Close / Volume data. For example, in

```{r, eval=FALSE}
getBars("ES1 Index")
```

the default values of six hourly bars for the lead ES future.

### getTicks: Transactional Tick Data


The `getTicks()` function retrieves tickdata, albeit with timestamps
at a minute granularity.  For example, the call

```{r, eval=FALSE}
getTicks("ES1 Index")
```

retrieves all ticks for the given security over the last hour. 

### fieldSearch: Query For Fields

The `fieldSearch()` helper function can search for available fields
which can be used with the `bdp()`, `bdh()` or `bds()` functions. For example,

```{r, eval=FALSE}
res <- fieldSearch("vwap")
```

search for fields describing volume-weighted average price fields

### beqs: Bloomberg EQS Queries

The `beqs()` function (which was contribued by Rademeyer Vermaak) can access
EQS functionality: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
beqs("Global Oil Companies YTD Return","GLOBAL")
```
