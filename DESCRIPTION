Description: An R Interface to 'Bloomberg' is provided via the 'Blp API'.
SystemRequirements: A valid Bloomberg installation. The API headers and
 dynamic library are downloaded from <https://github.com/Rblp/blp> during the
 build step. See <https://bloomberg.github.io/blpapi-docs/cpp/3.8> as well as
 <https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/support/api-library/> for API
 documentation. A compiler recent enough for (at least partial) C++11
 support is required; g++-4.6.* or later should be sufficient and g++-4.9.*
 or later is preferred.
