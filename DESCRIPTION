Description: An R Interface to 'Bloomberg' is provided via the 'Blp API'.
SystemRequirements: GNU make. A valid Bloomberg installation. The API headers and
 dynamic library are downloaded from <https://github.com/Rblp/blp> during the
 build step. See <https://bloomberg.github.io/blpapi-docs/cpp/3.24.6> as well as
 <https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/support/api-library/> for API
 documentation. Currently supported platforms are Windows and Linux (both for
 x86-64 processors only) as well as macOS (for arm64 only).  Other os-cpu pairings
 are not supported by Bloomberg and can therefore not be fully supported here.
