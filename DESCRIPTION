Description: An R Interface to Bloomberg is provided via the Blp API.
SystemRequirements: A valid Bloomberg installation. The API headers and
 dynamic library are downloaded from <https://github.com/Rblp/blp> during
 the build step. See <http://bloomberg.github.io/blpapi-docs/cpp/3.8> as 
 as <http://www.bloomberglabs.com/api/> for API documentation. A compiler
 recent enough for (at least partial) C++11 support; g++-4.6.* or later
 should be sufficient and g++-4.9.* or later is preferred.
