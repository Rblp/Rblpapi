Description: An R Interface to 'Bloomberg' is provided via the 'Blp API'.
SystemRequirements: A valid Bloomberg installation. The API headers and
 dynamic library are downloaded from <https://github.com/Rblp/blp> during
 the build step. See <https://bloomberg.github.io/blpapi-docs/cpp/3.8> as 
 well as <http://www.bloomberglabs.com/api/> for API documentation. A 
 compiler recent enough for (at least partial) C++11 support; g++-4.6.* 
 or later should be sufficient and g++-4.9.* or later is preferred.
